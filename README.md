A good deal of the rest of the thesis deals with the forward modelling of global reductions to gravity models, including a strategy to propagate uncertainties in the input mass to reductions.
This, along with an in-depth description of the numerical setup for the finite difference thermal solver, is of a more monographic nature and can be found only in the thesis.

A rendered pdf of the archived thesis (post-review, pre-defense version) is provided in a release: [releases/tag/postreview-version](https://github.com/apasto/apasto_phd_thesis/releases/tag/postreview-version).
