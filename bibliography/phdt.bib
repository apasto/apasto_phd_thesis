@article{Wieczorek2018,
abstract = {Geophysical analyses are often performed in spherical geometry and require the use of spherical harmonic functions to express observables or physical quantities. When expanded to high degree, the accuracy and speed of the spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions are of paramount importance. SHTools is a time and user-tested open-source archive of both Fortran 95 and Python routines for performing spherical harmonic analyses. The routines support all spherical-harmonic normalization conventions used in the geosciences, including 4p-normalized, Schmidt seminormalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized harmonics, along with the option of employing the Condon-Shortley phase factor of ð21Þ m. Data on the sphere can be sampled on a variety of grid formats, including equally spaced cylindrical grids and grids appropriate for integration by Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The spherical-harmonic transforms are proven to be fast and accurate for spherical harmonic degrees up to 2800. Several tools are provided for the geoscientist, including routines for performing localized spectral analyses and basic operations related to global gravity and magnetic fields. In the Python environment, operations are very simple to perform as a result of three class structures that encompass all operations on grids, spherical harmonic coefficients, and spatiospectral localization windows. SHTools is released under the unrestrictive BSD 3-clause license.},

@article{Driscoll1994,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of efficient computation of the spherical harmonic expansion, or Fourier transform, of functions defined on the two dimensional sphere, S2. The resulting algorithms are applied to the efficient computation of convolutions of functions on the sphere. We begin by proving convolution theorems generalizing well known and useful results from the abelian case. These convolution theorems are then used to develop a sampling theorem on the sphere. which reduces the calculation of Fourier transforms and convolutions of band-limited functions to discrete computations. We show how to perform these efficiently, starting with an O(n(log n)2) time algorithm for computing the Legendre transform of a function defined on the interval [-1,1] sampled at n points there. Theoretical and experimental results on the effects of finite precision arithmetic are presented. The Legendre transform algorithm is then generalized to obtain an algorithm for the Fourier transform, requiring O(n(log n)2) time, and an algorithm for its inverse in O(n1.5) time, where n is the number of points on the sphere at which the function is sampled. This improves the naive O(n2) bound, which is the best previously known. These transforms give an O(n1.5) algorithm for convolving two functions on the sphere. {\textcopyright} 1994 Academic Press, Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Sneeuw1994,
abstract = {Methods of global spherical harmonic analysis of discrete data on a sphere are placed in a historical context. The paper concentrates on the loss of orthogonality in the direction of latitude, due to the transition from continuous to discretized functions. Special attention is paid to Neumann's (1838) solution to this problem. By recasting the formulae of spherical harmonic analysis into matrix-vector notation, both least-squares solutions and quadrature methods are represented in a general framework of weighted least squares. It is also shown that the two-step formulation of global spherical harmonic computation was applied already by Neumann (1838) and Gauss (1839). Computational modifications to Neumann's method are reviewed as well.},
