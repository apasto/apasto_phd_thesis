Financial support was provided by Region Friuli Venezia Giulia (Italy) through an European Social Fund co-funded 3-year PhD fellowship ({HEaD}~{FP1687011001}), under the program `{{PO}~Friuli Venezia Giulia - Fondo Sociale Europeo 2014/2020}'.
The same funding source also supported a 12-month visiting period at the Institute of Astronomical and Physical Geodesy of the Technical University of Munich, under the supervision of Prof.~Roland Pail, which I gratefully thank for his availability.
Financial support for the abroad period was also supplemented by an International Mobility Scholarship, from resources of the University of Trieste.
All the maps were drawn with the Generic Mapping Tools \parencite[GMT,][]{GMT2013} and the {GMT/Matlab} toolbox \parencite{GMTmex2017}.
Part of the computations involved in this research benefited of resources provided by the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (www.lrz.de).
