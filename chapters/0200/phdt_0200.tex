\chapter{Supplementary: thermal forward modelling operator}
\label{c:ThermModel}

The thermal parameter fitting strategy and the obtained thermal model (chapter~\ref{c:ThermAppl}) rely on a finite-difference solver for the steady-state heat equation.
Its fundamental relationship can expressed in the following vector form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:heateq}
    \bm{\nabla} \cdot ( k(\bm{x}) \bm{\nabla} T(\bm{x}) ) = - A(\bm{x})
\end{equation}
with $k$ thermal conductivity (considered isotropic), $T$ temperature, $A$ heat production per unit of volume, and $\bm{x}$ position vector.
This form results from simplification of the well known heat equation in its full form \parencites{Fourier1822,Carslaw1959}, a heat source term included:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:fullheateq}
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \bm{\nabla}^2 T + \frac{A}{\rho c_p}
\end{equation}
where $t$ denotes time and $\alpha$ `thermal diffusivity', i.e. the product of thermal conductivity ($k$), density ($\rho$), and specific heat ($c_p$).
The steady-state assumption imposes:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:steadystate}
    \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = 0
\end{equation}
This allows simplification of Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:fullheateq} to:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq}
    0 = \rho c_p \left( k \bm{\nabla}^2 T + A \right)
\end{equation}
therefore:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified}
    k \bm{\nabla}^2 T = - A
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:heateq}, as expressed above \parencite[e.g. ][, chapter 3]{stuwe2007geodynamics}.
% NOTE! Not sure if heat equation with a non-uniform k is a Poisson's equation
%This is a partial differential equation (PDE), in the form of Poisson's equation ($\bm{\nabla}^2 \phi = f$, for two generic $\phi$ and $f$ functions).

Analytical solution to this partial differential equation exist: plenty are available for specific cases in the Earth sciences \parencites(see e.g. )()[][chapter 4.6]{Turcotte2014_geodynamics}[][chapter 3.4]{stuwe2007geodynamics}.
As pointed out by \textcite{Gerya2010} a pitfall of analytical methods for PDE solution is that they are "restricted to relatively simple problems" \parencite[][chapter 3.1]{Gerya2010}.
To analytically express the distribution of parameters' fields (e.g. $A$, $k$) is often cumbersome, sometimes impossible.
For the purposes of this thesis, a solver to the steady-state heat equation based on the finite-difference method \parencites()()[][chapter 4.2]{Patankar1980}[][chapter 10]{Gerya2010} was developed.
Resorting to finite differences implies discretising the infinite model continuum on a mesh of points, which describe the geometrical distribution of physical properties in the model, and then substituting the partial differential equations (i.e. the heat equation as in Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified} and the equations describing the boundary conditions) at the grid points with linear equations which locally approximate derivatives.
This procedure results in a system of linear equations, which is solved to obtain the value of the unknowns at each of the grid points.

Leaving the thorough description of the mathematical basis of finite differences (FD) and of the fundamentals of their implementation to the works cited above, this supplementary chapter provides a description on the modelling solution devised for the aim of this thesis.

\end{figure}

The heat equation under the assumed conditions (Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified}) can be formulated using \textit{central finite differences} for a node and its six neighbours in a 3-D rectangular grid.
The 7-node \textit{stencil} of this nodal configuration (i.e. its graphical representation) is shown in Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil}.

Remembering Fourier's law of heat conduction, which defines heat flux $Q$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:HeatFlux}
    \bm{Q} = -k \bm{\nabla} T
\end{equation}
we express it in the Leibniz's notation for Cartesian coordinates, which will come useful further in this description:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:HeatFlux_3D}
    \bm{Q} =
        -k \left( 
            \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \bm{\hat{i}} +
            \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \bm{\hat{j}} +
            \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \bm{\hat{k}}
        \right)
\end{equation}
with $\bm{\hat{i}}$, $\bm{\hat{j}}$, $\bm{\hat{k}}$ unit vectors of $x$, $y$, $z$ coordinates.
For the sake of clarity, we indicate each of these heat flux components as $Q_x$, $Q_y$, $Q_z$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:HeatFlux_3D_component}
    \bm{Q} = 
    \left(-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \bm{\hat{i}} \right) +
    \left(-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} \bm{\hat{j}} \right) +
    \left(-k \frac{\partial T}{\partial z} \bm{\hat{k}} \right) = Q_x + Q_y + Q_z
\end{equation}
By substituting this into the $k \bm{\nabla}^2 T$ term of Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified}, we get:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified_Q}
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} Q_x -
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} Q_y -
    \frac{\partial}{\partial x} Q_z = A
\end{equation}
Note that we also flipped the sign of both sides of the equation, to obtain a positive right-hand-side.

Turning to finite differences, Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified_Q} can be expressed for each internal node and its 6~neighbours in the model mesh, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil}.
Each $i$-th node is characterised with its associated parameters: $T_i$, $k_i$, $A_i$.
On each segment of the graph connecting `node $0$' and its neighbours we add a \textit{staggered node} representing the heat flux between the neighbour and the central node, therefore we have split each component of heat flux $\bm{Q}$ in its backwards and forwards parts, respect to the central node, along the direction defined by each of the unit vectors.
To prevent further cluttering Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil}, these $Q_{m,n}$ heat flux nodes are represented on a separate stencil, in Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil_staggered}.

\begin{figure}[ht] % stencil figure: fully staggered nodes

    The $m$ subscript denotes the axis, the $n$ subscript the along-axis direction ($b$ backwards, $f$ forwards).}
    \label{suppl:fig:stencil_staggered}
\end{figure}

Using one of the terms of Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified_Q} as an example, this implies that:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_example}
    - \frac{\partial}{\partial x} Q_x \approx
    - \frac{\Delta Q_x}{\Delta x} =
    \frac{-(Q_{x,f} - Q_{x,b})}{(s_{x,b} + s_{x,f}) / 2} =
    2 \frac{Q_{x,b} - Q_{x,f}}{s_{x,b} + s_{x,f}}
\end{equation}
The sketch provided in Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil_sketch} helps in representing the finite difference approximation just shown in Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:FD_example}.
In that figure the grid spacings $s_{x,b}$ and $s_{x,f}$ are plotted as sensibly different on purpose, to highlight the the fact that they may be not equal, in the general case.

    \label{suppl:fig:stencil_sketch}
\end{figure}

We can now write the FD approximation for the fluxes in Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:steadystatefullheateq_simplified_Q}:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_fluxes}
    2 \frac{Q_{x,b} - Q_{x,f}}{s_{x,b} + s_{x,f}} +
    2 \frac{Q_{y,b} - Q_{y,f}}{s_{y,b} + s_{y,f}} +
    2 \frac{Q_{z,b} - Q_{y,f}}{s_{z,b} + s_{z,f}} = A
\end{equation}

It is now the turn of FD approximation of the $Q_{m,n}$ fluxes at the staggered nodes.
Using node $Q_{x,b}$ an example (see Fig.~\ref{suppl:fig:stencil_sketch_flux} for a sketch):
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_staggered_example}
    Q_{x,b} =
    -k_{x,b} \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \approx
    -k_{x,b} \frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x} =
    -k_{x,b} \frac{T_0 - T_3}{s_{x,b}}
\end{equation}
A value of thermal conductivity at the staggered node has been added ($k_{x,b}$).
It is computed as the arithmetic average between the conductivities of the central node (node~$0$) and its neighbour (node~$3$ in this example):
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_staggered_example_conductivity}
    k_{x,b} = \frac{k_0 + k_3}{2}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[hb] % stencil figure: sketch for FD example, one flux

    \label{suppl:fig:stencil_sketch_flux}
\end{figure}

By doing so for all the remaining $Q_{m,n}$ fluxes at staggered nodes around node~$0$, Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:FD_fluxes} becomes:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_fluxes_complete}
    2 \frac{
            \left( -k_{x,b} \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_3}{s_{x,b}} \right ) -
            \left( -k_{x,f} \displaystyle \frac{T_4 - T_0}{s_{x,f}} \right )
        }{s_{x,b} + s_{x,f}} &+ \\[1ex]
    2 \frac{
            \left( -k_{y,b} \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_5}{s_{y,b}} \right ) -
            \left( -k_{y,f} \displaystyle \frac{T_6 - T_0}{s_{y,f}} \right )
        }{s_{y,b} + s_{y,f}} &+ \\[1ex]
    2 \frac{
            \left( -k_{z,b} \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_1}{s_{z,b}} \right ) -
            \left( -k_{z,f} \displaystyle \frac{T_2 - T_0}{s_{z,f}} \right )
        }{s_{z,b} + s_{z,f}} &= A
\end{split}
\end{align}
Further expressing the averaged conductivities at staggered nodes $k_{m,n}$, we obtain:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}    
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_fluxes_complete_k}
    2 \frac{
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_0 + k_3}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_3}{s_{x,b}}
            \right ) -
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_4 + k_0}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_4 - T_0}{s_{x,f}}
            \right )
        }{s_{x,b} + s_{x,f}} &+ \\[1ex]
    2 \frac{
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_0 + k_5}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_5}{s_{y,b}} \right ) -
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_6 + k_0}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_6 - T_0}{s_{y,f}}
            \right )
        }{s_{y,b} + s_{y,f}} &+ \\[1ex]
    2 \frac{
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_0 + k_1}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_0 - T_1}{s_{z,b}}
            \right ) -
            \left(
                \displaystyle \frac{k_2 + k_0}{2}
                \displaystyle \frac{T_2 - T_0}{s_{z,f}}
            \right )
        }{s_{z,b} + s_{z,f}} &= A
\end{split}
\end{align}

We started with the FD discretisation of fluxes at the central node (Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:FD_fluxes}), then formulated the FD discretisation of fluxes at staggered nodes (Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:FD_staggered_example}).
This is called a `conservative finite-difference discretisation', which allows for variable thermal conductivity.
\textcite{Gerya2010} provides a thorough explanation on its rationale, using the Stokes equation with variable viscosity and the Lagrangian heat conservation equation (non-steady state) as examples.

\section[
    tocentry={From the FD formulation to a system of linear equations},
    head={From the FD formulation to a system of linear equations}
    ]{From the finite difference formulation to a system of linear equations}
\label{s:ThermModel:FD_LinSyst}

With the derivation described in the previous section, a finite-difference approximation for the steady-state heat equation was obtained for one node, surrounded by a neighbour in each Cartesian direction.
In order to turn that into a thermal model, we need to transform the FD formulations of each node into a system of linear equations.
In addition, the boundary conditions must be defined and specified in the appropriate form.
The system is in the following form:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_LinSyst_form}
    \bm{L} \bm{T} = \bm{R}
\end{equation}
For a system of $n$ equations (i.e.~$n$ nodes, including those used to impose boundary conditions), $\bm{T}$ is $n$~by~\num{1} vector of unknowns (the sought temperature at each node), $\bm{R}$ is a \num{1}~by~$n$ vector of the right-hand-sides of the equations, and $\bm{L}$ is a $n$~by~$n$ matrix of coefficients which multiply the elements of $T$.
In the FD modelling case of this thesis, $\bm{L}$ is a sparse matrix, i.e. most of its elements are zero.
This is a direct consequence of the 7-nodes stencil that define the parameters of the heat equation in each node: each linear equation, thus each line in matrix $\bm{L}$, has 7 non-zero parameters for inner nodes.
As described afterwards, boundary nodes have one to two non-zero elements in $\bm{L}$, depending on their type.

By expressing an FD model as a system of linear equations (Eq.~\ref{suppl:eq:FD_LinSyst_form}) we can solve for the unknown $\bm{T}$, provided that $\bm{L}$ is nonsingular:
\begin{equation}
    \label{suppl:eq:FD_LinSyst_inversion}
    \bm{T} = \bm{L}^{-1} \bm{R}
\end{equation}

As mentioned when describing the thermal application (chapter~\ref{c:ThermAppl}), for the aim of this thesis $\bm{L}$ was inverted using the \textit{UMFPACK} factorization for sparse matrices \parencite{Davis2006}.
% Providing its description here may be well beyond the scope of this thesis.
In computational terms, it is a direct solver.
For an increasing number of dimensions and model nodes it may result in an unmanageable amount of memory.
The call to a fall-back alternative, an iterative solver \parencite[the generalized minimal residual method, \textit{gmres}, see][]{Saad1986gmres}, has been included in the code, but it never occurred to require resorting to it, in the experiments described here.
